For a tool to be considered, it has to have these features: 
- Cross platform: I do my work on a macbook and my primary phone is android. At home I use an ubuntu machine. Therefore, cross-platform is a must
- Create lists

## Wunderlist

This tool has been great so far, however it's going to be retired soon in favor of Microsoft To-Do. The replacement looks promising, however it's still in early stage, and its integration with MS suite means that there would be a lot of baggage for using this app. 

### Pros:

- easy to use
- simple interface
- task reminder. While this seems to be an obvious feature, it's not (more on this later)

### Cons:

- Going to be retired soon
- Can't archive lists. This mean when you want to reuse a list, you will have to keep it forever. I'd like to keep my list of item list for each trips separated, but I don't like keeping them around once the trip is done. Something like google keep archive feature would be nice

## AnyDo

Switching from Wunderlist to AnyDo is quite a pain because their interfaces are different

### Pros:

- Have most of must-have features

### Cons:

- Reminder interface sucks
- Overal interface looks futuristic but usability is terrible. One has to click multiple time to get to where the target list is, and going back is even worse

## Ticktick

### Pros:

- Able to import tasks from Wunderlist!
